## Tweet processing : cleaning tweets and classify them

This repository demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be performed on French political discourse. We use a dataset of French tweets published by French politicians, specifically focused on the topic of immigration. The corpus is sourced from the Olindinum corpora, a valuable resource for linguistic and social research.
